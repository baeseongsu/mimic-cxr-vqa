## Description
The MIMIC-CXR-VQA dataset is a complex, diverse, and large-scale resource designed specifically for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks in the medical domain. This dataset, primarily focusing on chest radiographs, was created from the MIMIC-CXR-JPG and Chest ImaGenome datasets, both sourced from Physionet. This dataset not only provides a benchmark for assessing the effectiveness of existing medical VQA approaches but also serves as a basis for multi-modal Electronic Health Record (EHR) questions.
